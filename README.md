# Kernel-Methods
Analysis of the kernel trick's significance in different machine learning applications by the following experiments
1. Demonstration of the significance of Kernel SVM over Vanilla(linear) SVM in Python without using built-in functions to learn non-linear XOR data.
2. Implementation of the kernel ridge regression by kernelising the linear ridge regression predictor using noisy sinusoidal data points.
3. Implementation of the vanilla (linear) PCA and kernel versions of (PCA) to demonstrate the utility of kernel PCA and generate data points for which the vanilla PCA fails while kernel PCA works.
